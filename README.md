A water bath is one piece of equipment in a molecular biology lab for several reasons:

Temperature Control: It provides a stable and controlled temperature environment, which is important for many biochemical reactions and processes including measuring pH. This ensures that samples are heated evenly and consistently.
It could be used in LAMP reactions.

Versatility: They can be used for a variety of applications, including thawing samples, incubating cultures, and performing enzymatic reactions, making them a versatile tool in the lab.

In summary, a water bath is good for providing the precise temperature control needed for successful molecular biology experiments

I usually use the PCR machine for small samples but I cannot measure pH directly in small tubes and while that can be done bfor y adding hot water in a pot I finally decided to design and build a water bath.
This is such a simple build that I just documented that in a video. If you are patient enough to 3D print for 2 days you can also try the 3D model included. I found a decent project box so I was spared the aggravation. 

I tested it to 50 Celsius. It's slow to get there so better start with hot water. If you need more add another serial silicone heat pad or you can do parallel and change the power supply to 24 volts. The pads can be 20 watts  or 30 watts.
